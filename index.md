# Welcome

The Environmental Statistics Section was originally formed as a Study Group in 1996 under the auspices of the General Applications Section, but now has full Section status. The committee has been organising meetings on a wide variety of topics of interest to statisticians and other environmental scientists. Our objectives include acting as a national focus for statisticians involved in environmental work. The Section also provides a cadre of experts on whom the Society can call for professional advice.

As well as organising meetings, the Section maintains the ENVSTAT mailing list. This provides a forum for announcements and discussion on topics relating to environmental statistics.
